# OpenMarket
The Metaverse Shopping Experience project is an open source initiative that aims to create a seamless and immersive shopping experience in the metaverse. Our platform will enable users to register and create unique avatars within the blockchain, and acquire virtual objects using in-game credits that are also backed by blockchain technology. Our goal is to create a decentralized and secure shopping experience that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of technical expertise or financial resources.

# Our Vision
Our vision is to create a world where shopping experiences are seamless, immersive and engaging. We believe that the metaverse is the perfect platform to bring this vision to life. By using blockchain technology to create unique avatars and in-game credits, we can provide users with a truly decentralized and secure shopping experience.

We envision a metaverse that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their geographical location or socioeconomic background. We believe that the metaverse has the potential to create a more equitable and fair world, where everyone has the opportunity to participate and benefit from the virtual economy.
